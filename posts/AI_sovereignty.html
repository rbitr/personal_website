<p><h2>AI Sovereignty in Canada</h2></p>
<p>Andrew Marble<br><a href="https://marble.onl">marble.onl</a><br>andrew@willows.ai<br>November 5, 2025</a></p>
<p>Since Canada has been throwing around quotes from US Presidents
recently, there are two I find very relevant to Canada’s AI
industry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Government is not the solution to the problem: government is the
problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Reagan</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do
for your country.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— JFK</p>
<p>Canada’s budget was announced yesterday and included the promise of a
made-in-canada “AI Tool”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… will develop a made-in-Canada AI tool that can be deployed across
the federal government. Shared Services Canada will partner with leading
Canadian AI companies to develop this internal tool. By supporting
innovative research to strengthen public services, this work will
protect our digital sovereignty, keep government data and information
safe in Canada, and create opportunities for the Canadian technology
sector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most charitable reading I can give is that there are national
security reasons why the nature and purpose of this “tool” are not
mentioned (it is to be built in partnership with the Department of
National Defence and the Communications Security Establishment). </p>
<p>Regardless, in practice the outcome will almost certainly be
overpaying some politically connected companies for an inferior product,
in the name of sovereignty and being “Made-in-Canada”. </p>
<p>Sovereign capability is important, and I have been thinking about it
a lot recently. Though no indication of what the “tool” the government
will build is given, having AI models, specifically large transformer
models like GPT et al., and the capability to train them, is a key
aspect of sovereignty. At the same time, I see little value in having
our own home-made tools if they are not competitive. </p>
<p>If we are concerned about autonomy, we would be better to just
download new releases of the best open models as they become available
and archive them. These models can be run locally without reliance on
foreign tech companies, and choosing the best would mean we have world
class models at our disposal. On the other hand, building a
made-in-canada model that is not among the best, would leave us with an
inferior product that nobody will use and that would leave us
disadvantaged should the need for autonomy arise. </p>
<p>If the above sounds like a false dichotomy (use foreign models or use
inferior ones) then we need a way to properly measure the
competitiveness of anything we build ourselves and make this our focus.
I would suggest there is an easy test for whether we’ve built a good AI
model: other people and organizations use it. It’s not enough to be an
also-ran, we need to focus on making something globally competitive if
we want to pursue sovereignty. The US and China know this and both have
industry-led, globally competitive AI and strong sovereign capabilities.
If our goal isn’t at least to place amongst the top handful of globally
relevant models, we might as well not bother.</p>
<p>Measuring success thus comes down to measuring downloads, mentions,
and incorporation into other projects. If we can make something other
people want, we will have demonstrated that we have a sovereign AI
capability, with both the work product (the model) but also the
expertise to remain cutting edge. While obviously difficult, with the
right focus building a popular and powerful model is still a realistic
goal. There are lots of unmet needs and lots of unaddressed issues that
provide opportunities to make models that are both generically "better"
and better address factors that make them popular to use.</p>
<p>I would argue that such a system will never come from the Canadian
government (regardless of the party in power), either as a direct
undertaking, or by the government commissioning a third party (which
will inevitably suffer the fate of all government procurements and
optimize for the wrong things). Worse, the market distortion caused by
government efforts in this area ends up drawing off talent and attention
and distracts industry from developing real market competitive
capabilities. </p>
<p>Building a Canadian AI capability is a challenge for the Canadian
private sector to take on, dually motivated by helping create a vital
sovereign capability, but also by the profits and recognition that come
from building a world class AI model. The sooner we (the Canadian AI
industry) stop looking to government for support and start building, the
sooner we begin to realize real market competitive, sovereign AI
capability. </p>
